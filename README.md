# K-Means Clustering in Java

## Project Overview
This Java project implements the K-means clustering algorithm for categorizing 2-D data based on their positions on a Cartesian plane. Users can specify the number of categories (clusters) for classification. The project includes several key components:
- `KMeans.java`: Contains the main function.
- `Point.java`: Defines a point in 2D space.
- `Cluster.java`: Represents a cluster of points in close proximity.
- `CSVHelper`: Assists in parsing CSV files to create a 2D array of points.
- Sample CSV files: Provided as sample data.

## Technical Requirements
- Java: Compatible with the most recent version of Java.
- External Libraries: No external libraries required.

## Usage
Run `KMeans.java` to start the clustering process. The user can specify the number of clusters. Sample CSV files can be used to test the functionality.
